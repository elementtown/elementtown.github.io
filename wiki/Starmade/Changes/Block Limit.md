Block & Mass Limit

Don't be discouraged, limits can be fun! Just think, a server with ships/pirates/stations that do not completely overpower each other with sheer block count at any time. This provides a challenging environment at all times, and is easy on your hardware! After all, Starmade is run by Java, not C++.  Give it a break.


*The only exceptions for the mass w/rail limit is when it's possible to do the following:

1. The Docked Ship must be able to be operated from the Hotbar with Logic.

2. The Docked Ship must be un-dockable from a pickup and drop off rail.

3. The Docked Ship must not be edited in build mode.

4. The Main Ship must be considered a "Carrier" by official game standards (It must be able to issue commands to the ships you have docked).


*The docked Ship must not contribute to the main Ship/Station in any way, here are some examples:

1. Attacking with the docked ship.

2. Protecting your main ship from attacks.

3. Sharing Shield, Power, or Thrust.


*Using multiple Planet Fragments to contribute to 1 Planet Fragment or Station is not allowed. It avoids the limit for very obvious reasons.

Description
Ship
	
100,000
	
15,000
	
- Limit in place for hardware and server performance.
- Provides a challenging environment, no ship is too big.
- Encourages Fleets and specialized Carriers.
Station / Planet Fragment
	
1,000,000
	
150,000
	
- Stations are 10x stronger than ships to prevent ship domination.
- Planet bases may take terraforming to exceed the limit.
- Fleets are encouraged to take on stations.
