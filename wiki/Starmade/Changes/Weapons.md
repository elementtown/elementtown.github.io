Weapon Changes
The weapon stats shown here are NOT default settings. Most stats have been given equivalent exchanges to certain values such as speed, rate of fire, reload, and so on.  The column on the left shows a nickname for each secondary for what it does. Nicknaming them makes it easy to reference them in game, and it's a way to condense information in your head on how to make a ship designed for combat. The main stat you should pay attention to is range, most weapons now do more damage the closer you are.

Cannons by default is quite average all around, and well accepted. But since recent updates, they allowed missiles to have HP, and that is bad for AMT's.
Cannons are now designed so Missile secondary has AMT potential, and Pulse secondary is highly effective against immobile targets (like stations, or planets, or stupid AI). Cannon and Beam secondaries are still all-around average in terms of damage, power consumption, and usage.

Beams by default were basically the same thing as the Cannon, but with shorter range.
Beams are now designed to be extremely unique. Some values were never adjusted before until now such as tick rate, and initial hit. Each secondary now varies greatly from each other, and is now highly diverse in and out of combat!

Missiles by default were messy. Messy is a great word for dumb-fire solo rockets, heat-seeker swarms that would lag servers and completely nuke ships, then Beam and Pulse are basically the same thing except they exchange speed/damage for power/cool-down by half or so. With the Missile HP to Damage however, they made both beam/pulse very strong.

Missiles are now sexy. Sexy is a great word for Homing Missile Mini Guns, proper Anti-AMT Shotgun Swarms, and less logic vs cool-down issues. That's right, Cannon secondary is now a 1 second cool-down heat-seeking homing launcher setup, perfectly made for simple logic clocks. Missile now shoots a spread of missiles that creates a blanket of dumb-fire missiles made to specifically combat AMT's. Beam and Pulse are now more different from each-other by a 1/3 instead of a 1/2 with some slight modifications to Pulse that affects the Missile HP.

Pulse used to be bad.
Pulse is hard to use no matter how much it's been buffed, so I hope you can find a use for it! They are all quite unique but it's hard to hit anything that moves, and the damage scales with the size of the entity it's hitting.
