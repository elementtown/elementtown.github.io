1. Introduction
This Data Cube contains information on how to survive and thrive in the West Coast Space.
It's contents may change or new content may be added at any time, and will serve as a guide to you as you play.
Simply observe the description here to view the Data Cube (you are using it right now). It's best observed in a shop, as the description box is rather large and can be expanded. 
*WARNING* This guide assumes you have done the in-game tutorial.

Here's some Terminology:
Turret - An AI controlled ship you dock on your main ship which operates as an automated firing device.
AMT - Anti-Missile Turret. There’s also such thing as Anti-Anti-Missile Turrets.
Array - A checkerboard like pattern used for covering a large area. Useful for Salvage Modules.
Alpha strike - Usually referring to a series of missile strikes where swarms of missiles are low damage for AMT’s, while 1 or few missiles deal far more damage.
Saturation - an Array of modules spreaded out to hit a target easier.
con. - Consumption. Usually referring to Power, thrust, or shield consumption.
M/s - Meters per second. 1 Block = Meter.

2. Rules
- Do not cause lag from planets from mining or landing on it without docking.
- Let new players make a home base.
- Common sense

3. Mining 101
- Global mining Bonus x4.
- Faction mining Bonus x12
You can freely travel the galaxy and mine as you please, just stay clear of pirate stations. To get started efficiently, you will need to make an “Array”. Array's are made when 1 Salvage Computer hooks up several Salvage Modules that are not touching, in a tight “checkerboard” pattern. To make this, try starting with 4 Modules and make each one fire individual beams, just to get the idea of what to do. Once you know how to make checkerboards, it's time to make the Array. Build a checkerboard array behind, or in-front another, but offset the whole pattern sideways by one. So when you fire, it will shoot a “Mining Array” which should punch a consistent hole in anything you salvage. Make it big and strong enough, and you can one-shot asteroids and small planet fragments! Literally, they will despawn instantly.
- Salvage/Missile is 2x more powerful.

4. Scouting/Evasion tactics
- Max Normal speed 200m/s
Maintain a low mass, high thrust, and don’t get hit, and you will maintain a solid 200 m/s
- Max Overdrive speed 300m/s
Equip an Overdrive Computer and some Modules on your ship for some extra speed at the cost of more power. Speeeed racer!

5. Power Consumption and You
- Softcap is 2,000,000 e/s
Power is the most important part of Starmade. Power Modules can be installed in a number of different ways, all coming from one rule, and they all need to be mastered. I’m not gonna try to explain it how it is described in the wiki, but only describe examples that work and examples that do not work. NOTE: the Power Modules must be 1 block line. Making them “Thicker” or placing a 2x2x2 block of them is a complete no-no.
Power Module Examples:
I L T or + shapes work best because they stretch to their furthest XYZ dimension with the least amount of blocks.
Power Module Failures:
U Y N O H G K or anything else that is a loop or stretches in the same dimension twice will not produce very much Power.
Try to imagine both of these examples as a 3D shape as well, since stretching the Power Modules out on all 3-6 directions greatly increases the recharge rate.  Eventually you will find yourself getting tangled up by trying to overlap the other power module lines but not touching them. This is when real planning comes in, when you have to plan your entire ship around the Power Module lines, or make the ship body big enough to contain the Power Modules easily, and achieve the Softcap.
It takes an average of 3000-6000 Power Modules to reach 2,000,000 e/s

6. Art of Defense
TIP: Don’t panic.
- Structure HP
This is when you have nothing left to protect yourself, once it hits 50%, your ship overheats.
-Block HP
All blocks have different kinds of HP, but can only go up to 255. These kind of blocks can be constantly healed with an Astrotech module for an effective “Regenerating armor” effect.
- Armor
Armor protects Structure HP and Block HP, and serves are a second HP bar with a damage reduction rating depending on which block is being hit. 
- Shields
Shields is your first line of defense against anything that comes at you, so it’s wise to buy Ion effect to raise the damage reduction of shields as well. The whole process can be expensive, but will eventually reward you with the power to completely tank your enemies DPS. The battle is won before it is fought.
- Computers
Armor your computers up, because if those things get hit, it doesn’t matter how many cannon modules you have, it won’t fire anymore.
- Mobility
Mobility is ultimately the greatest asset of Defense, but also offense (more on that below). If you can enter or exit a fight without your enemies being able to look at you, then you know you won’t need to take their full DPS into consideration. In other words, keep moving, you have been warned. If you can use Cloak and Radar Jam, then you don’t need any protection until you are scanned.

7. Art of Offense
- Maximizing Structure Damage
When you want to overheat a ship quickly, that means you want to completely nuke the ship’s Structure HP. You can go about this in two ways: Beam/Cannon Array, or a powerful Missile or Pulse AOE blast. Weather it be a series of missiles, or one offical Nuke, there are many ways to achieve results, but only a few that are considered a “Kill-switch”.
- Dealing with Armor
Use Punchthrough and Piercing to break down advanced armor and forcefields.
- Popping Shields                        
Use Ion and EMP to pop shields very quickly.
- Computers
Using multiple computers can be effective for missile systems where the power consumption would be too large to use all the modules at once. Great for smaller ships where space limitation is an issue.

8. Art of Support
- What is Support?
- Bypassing the Softcap
- Self-Sustainability
- Other Support Tools

9. Technical Stuff
- Trickery (Exploits)
- Fleets
- Hotkeys
