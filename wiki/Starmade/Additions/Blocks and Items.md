New Blocks/Items

Just FYI there is no way to make new shield, power, or thrust blocks with their own properties. I can only modify things that are in the block editor currently.
Blocks/Items
	
 Description
Gravitium
	
  -2.5 Mass block. When placed on a ship, it lowers the mass by 2.5. Mass can even go into the negative, and strange things can happen to your ship if you try to repeatedly remove/place Gravitium on other entities to "exploit" it's use. If you happen to obtain it, place once, and do not remove it without deconstructing the ship entirely. The block has no recipe, and is not found in the shop. 

It's an EVENT ONLY BLOCK.
Kinetic Barrier
	
 Sacrifices Mass for more Armor/Structure HP. This block has no armor, so it must be protected in order to preserve the large armor buff it has. While it raises your structure, be aware of how much structure you have vs the Kinetic Barriers you are placing on the ship. So in other words, it's possible to create "weak points" in your ship, while making your armor stronger.
