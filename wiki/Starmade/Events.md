- Invasion Event: Community must vote for this event to occur.
  For 1 hour, everyone must defend themselves against a series
  of random pirate spawns throughout the day. Home base
  invulnerability will be disabled as well. If damage reaches
  catalytic failure, a rollback will occur at the end of the day,
  reversing everything that happened. If the community succeeds
  in repelling the pirate spawns, everyone will be granted Gravitium,
  and a lot of pirate loot from the battle.
