There was only, chaos . . .

Then suddenly, a server owner appeared!

He immediately began to tinker with the settings of the universe, the balance of everything being thrown, tossed, turned. Eventually, they all seemed to be in place. . . Or so it seemed.

Astronauts of all skins were brought forth to the universe, and immediately voiced their view points, good ones at that. The owner listened, but also Vincore, which was one of the chosen to be an Admin, a trusted over watch of the universe.

Vincore, dissatisfied with the spawns appearance, decided to change many things to the Origins, a Station which served as a Intergalactic Beacon for Astronauts led astray. As if Vincore could tell the future, he built the ideal vision of a spawn.

Quickly, Astronauts came swooping in from all directions, everyday the universe would populate, but occasionally be destroyed by the randomness of a server still in it's development stages. Slowly, the community gained a foothold on the harsh universe, while some have jumped straight to the top through strange occurrences in the randomness. Mister K was one of those individuals.

Astronauts like Mister K used all that he had at his fingertips with the power that was bestowed upon him some time ago. Both the Owner and Admin is currently pleased by the results of testing the limits of the universe, despite the flux. We listened and all agreed, it had to be balanced, AND diverse.

And so, West Coast Space was raised from a mature community during it's development stage.

A server is more than about owning it, but sharing it.
